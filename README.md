Purple Auth UI is a modern dark-themed user interface built using pure HTML and CSS. The project features a login and signup system with smooth transitions between forms and a simple application dashboard layout. All interactions are handled without JavaScript, using hidden checkboxes and CSS selectors to manage state changes and page transitions. The design uses a dark color palette with purple accents, CSS variables for easy customization, and Font Awesome icons for better visual clarity. This project is ideal for practicing advanced CSS techniques, understanding UI state management without JavaScript, and showcasing a clean beginner-friendly frontend project. It can be easily extended with JavaScript or backend functionality in the future.
